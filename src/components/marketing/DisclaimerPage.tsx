              Trading options involves significant financial risk. Options can expire worthless, resulting in a total loss 
              of the premium paid. The value of options can fluctuate rapidly due to changes in the underlying asset price, 
              time decay, implied volatility, and other market factors.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Before trading options, you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, 
              and risk tolerance. You should be aware of all the risks associated with options trading and seek advice 
              from an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts.
